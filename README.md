===================================

.. module:: New File
   :synopsis: Sometimes you want a little more control over your source file and where you want to save it
              rather than use something like tkFileDialog where the user has the choice over the location. 
             The new_file modlue allows you to direct to the location of the template file, choose the file 
             name and select the directory it is in.
